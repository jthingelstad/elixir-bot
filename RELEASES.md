## v4.2 — Race Command

**Date:** 2026-04-11

Elixir's River Race intelligence and internal architecture both got sharper in this release. The LLM tool layer was consolidated from 51 tools down to 15 domain-aligned tools, and the #river-race channel now carries real situational awareness of the competitive field and the clan's historic win streak.

### Tool Layer Consolidation

- Collapsed 51 single-purpose LLM tools into 15 domain-aligned tools with aspect-based routing (e.g. `get_war_season(aspect="standings")` instead of separate `get_war_champ_standings`).
- Reduces prompt overhead and gives the LLM cleaner, more predictable tool interfaces.

### River Race — Competing Clan Awareness

- The #river-race subagent now references competing clans by name with fame-gap framing — who's closest, who's falling behind, and snarky commentary when a rival barely shows up.
- Race standings data was already passed to the LLM but previously ignored; the prompt now actively instructs Elixir to use it.

### River Race — Win Streak Memory

- Introduced unscoped "clan identity" durable memories that load for the river-race subagent regardless of which war week is active.
- A race win streak memory is auto-updated on each `war_week_complete` signal by counting consecutive 1st-place finishes in the `war_races` table.
- POAP KINGS' unbroken 1st-place streak (Season 129 Week 2 to present) is now part of Elixir's River Race voice.

### River Race — Day Transition Consolidation

- When a battle day ends and a new one starts simultaneously, the two signals (`*_complete` + `*_started`) are now merged into a single batch, producing one cohesive message instead of two back-to-back posts.
- Applies to all day transition types: battle-to-battle, practice-to-battle, practice-to-practice.

### Structural

- Split large modules and tightened exception handling across the codebase.
- Added API retry logic for transient Clash Royale API failures.
- Fixed 3 pre-existing test failures from stale patch targets.
- Tightened promotion content: non-ASCII escaping in JSON output, more concise copy.

## v4.1 — Card Quiz

**Date:** 2026-04-07

Elixir gained a card catalog foundation and a new interactive quiz experience in `#card-quiz`. Members can now test and sharpen their Clash Royale card knowledge directly inside Discord.

### Card Catalog

- Added a synced card catalog from the Clash Royale `/cards` API (121 standard cards, daily refresh at 4 AM CT).
- New `lookup_cards` LLM tool gives Elixir accurate card data (elixir cost, rarity, type, Evo/Hero capability) so it stops guessing when members ask about card stats or tradeoffs in `#ask-elixir`.
- Card catalog syncs at startup and daily via the activity scheduler.

### Card Quiz (`#card-quiz`)

- `/elixir quiz start` — start an interactive quiz session (1-10 questions, ephemeral to the member).
- `/elixir quiz stats` — view personal accuracy and daily streak.
- `/elixir quiz leaderboard` — daily streak rankings.
- A daily quiz question is posted automatically each morning at 10 AM CT.

**Question types (v1):**
- What is the elixir cost of this card?
- Which of these cards costs the most/least elixir?
- What rarity is this card?
- Is this card a troop, spell, or building?
- Does this card support Evo, Hero, both, or neither?
- Which of these cards is a Champion?

All questions are generated from real card catalog data with card images. Daily questions track streaks for consecutive correct answers.

### Structural

- Renamed `integrations/` to `modules/` — both `poap_kings` and `card_training` now live under a unified feature module directory.
